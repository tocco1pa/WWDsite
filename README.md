# WWDsite
A functioning and interactive website for a fake company built with HTML/JavaScript

This website was my capstone project for my Web Development class and was built over the final two months of the class.
Utilizing the knowledge we had gained throughout the semester, I created a fake web development company and fit their
needs through multiple web pages with various functions. The website features a blend of back-end and front-end coding
practices and implements numerous basic coding principles such as data structures, recursion, design elements, and CSS.
